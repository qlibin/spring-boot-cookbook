/**
 * Command line runners are a useful functionality to execute the various types of code that only have to be run once,
 * right after application startup. Some may also use this as a place to start various executor threads
 * but Spring Boot provides a better solution for this task, which will be discussed at the end of this chapter.
 * The CommandLineRunner interface is used by Spring Boot to scan all of its implementations and invoke each instance's
 * run method with the startup arguments. We can also use an @Order annotation or implement an Ordered interface
 * so as to define the exact order in which we want Spring Boot to execute them. For example,
 * Spring Batch relies on the runners in order to trigger the execution of the jobs.
 *
 * As command-line runners are instantiated and executed after the application has started, we can use the dependency
 * injection to our advantage in order to wire in whatever dependencies that we need, such as data sources, services,
 * and other components. These can be utilized later while implementing run(String... args) method..
 *
 * Note
 * It is important to note that if any exceptions are thrown inside the run(Stringâ€¦ args) method,
 * this will cause the context to close and an application to shut down.
 * Wrapping the risky code blocks with try/catch is recommended in order to prevent this from happening.
